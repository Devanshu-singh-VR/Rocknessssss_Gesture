Problem Faced:-

      detect organs in blurry and little dark vision.

-> My Solution:-
    ● For better vision I used Binary and Truncate Thresholding after
      converting the BGR image to a Gray colored image, the machine can
      classify these images better than previous images. This improves the
      performance of the model
